# DD2477-Project


1. Clone the repository
   
git clone https://github.com/your-org/DD2447-Project.git  
cd DD2447-Project

---

2. Set up environment variables

Add the .env file that was shared via WhatsApp to DD2477 root  

---

3. Create the Docker network (only needed the first time)

docker network create musicxmlnet

---

4. Start the app stack

docker compose up --build

This will:
- Start Elasticsearch and Kibana
- Build and start the Node.js web app
- Load your environment variables automatically from `.env`

---

5. One-time setup (roles, user, sample data)

Once the containers are running, run the setup script:

chmod +x setup.sh  
./setup.sh

This will:
- Create the `music_reader` role
- Create the `kibanabot` user
- Index the provided `bulk_music.json` sample data

---

6. Access the apps

- Web app: http://localhost:3000  
- Kibana: http://localhost:5601  
  Log in using either:
  - elastic / your password
  - kibanabot / app password

---

## Cleanup

To stop all services:

docker compose down

To also clear all volumes and passwords:

docker compose down -v  
docker network rm musicxmlnet

## 🗓️ April 3rd Meeting Notes

Sources of musicxml docs for corpus:
- https://zenodo.org/records/14984509
- https://www.musicxml.com/music-in-musicxml/example-set/

Potential ideas:
- Each token is a concatenation of musical attributions (pitch, duration, sharp/flat, etc.)
- Use n-gram or phrase for melody matching
- Tolerance for differences in melodies
- Implement relevance feedback
- Normalization within the attributes (similar rhythms that may have different durations, normalize the key like Johan suggested)

Random tweaks to improve musical matching (not so important, but helpful):
- A natural sign in front of note should be same as notes with no natural sign of otherwise same characteristics
- Remove grace notes, trill, mordents, slides to increase match rate

## 🗓️ April 8th Meeting Notes

### 🎯 Tasks
- [ ] **Figure out how to add a front-end or search GUI using Kibana**  
  - Ideally use Kibana’s dev tools or something like that
  - **Fallback:** use GUI from course assignemnts

- [ ] **Clarify query differences:**
  - `match`: unordered token match (like keyword search)
  - `match_phrase`: ordered, exact match (hopefully useful for motifs/melodies). But do we need one long string for token? Or does elasticsearch have indices for each token order. And do we instead need to make an n-gram index?

### 🧠 Potential Project Goal: Motif / Melody Matching

Our goal is to build a flexible search engine for symbolic music queries, supporting different motif types:

#### 1. 🎼 Pitch-Based
- **Exact match** on tokens like `"C4_quarter D4_quarter E4_quarter"`

#### 2. 🥁 Rhythmic
- Match based **only on durations**
- Strip pitch and octave (e.g. `"quarter quarter half"`) on the search. This is the front-heavy processing approach, slower with real-time searching potentially
- Or make another query field instead of token, like rhythms, when indexings 

#### 3. 🔁 Transposition-Invariant
- Match motifs **regardless of key**
- Maybe use **interval representation** (e.g. `+2 +2 +3`)
- Options:
  - Transpose motif to 16 possible searches
  - Or use the numerical interval representation

 Maybe also use slop or fuzzy search somewhere for ornaments and rest
